\chapter{Summary}
The SW06 experiment has provided high quality acoustic and
environmental data to investigate the acoustic wave interaction with
internal waves. Preliminary analysis of the acoustic data and
observations of radar images and temperature records shows that
during the passage of an ISW event, horizontal refraction results in
significant acoustic intensity variation. This observation agrees
with the recently proposed theory of sound propagation through ISW.3
Future work includes mode and frequency filtering of this acoustic
data as well as modeling to establish the transition of acoustic
field behavior from adiabatic to other mechanisms when an ISW passes
an acoustic track.
