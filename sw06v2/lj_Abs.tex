% Thesis Abstract ------------------------------------------------------

Fluctuations of the low frequency sound field in the presence of an
internal solitary wave packet during the Shallow Water '06 (SW06)
experiment are analyzed. Acoustic, environmental, and on-board ship
radar image data were collected simultaneously before, during, and
after a strong internal solitary wave packet passed through the
acoustic track. Preliminary analysis of the acoustic wave temporal
intensity fluctuations agrees with previously observed phenomena and
the existing theory of the horizontal refraction mechanism, which
causes focusing and defocusing when the acoustic track is nearly
parallel to the front of the internal waves.
